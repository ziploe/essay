thinking why things will happen when it had already happened
you find that things do not happen as a coincidence, most times
they are bound to happen, as a result of the integration of all
small stuff.
This seems to be useful when predicting the future. Ceratinly the 
future is predictable in a sense, though not so accurate. By thinking
the past you could analyse the facts that will contribute to the 
future, and get a rough image of future, the more you could see through
the reason that will eventually contribute to the future the more
accurate your image will be. this image can not be accurate because
before things happen, it is so hard for you to know the total stuffs,
though you could see them clearly when it had already happened.
So, in this way, the future is in our hand! by doing things which will
make you more what you want to be,you could shape the future!In this way
it seems that we are free.
yet, another thing occured to me seems to be quite worse.
You can choose what you want to be, but what if your choices are limited?
(for example: You can buy any kind of cell phone you want, but what if
your information is limited? how could you buy <BlackBerry> and 
<Blackphone> if you don't even know they exist?)
This is terrible, hope you can always be aware.
